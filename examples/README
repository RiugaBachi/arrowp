Miscellaneous example of arrow notation.

To turn these into Haskell you'll need the arrow preprocessor.

They all translate into Haskell 98, and (except for cgi) can be run.

All the examples require Control.Arrow.
The starred ones also require the arrow transformer library:

cgi
	Translation of John Hughes's simplified account of his CGI library.
	(Typechecks, but doesn't do anything.)

circuit *
	More circuit examples, and another circuit arrow type.

parser *
	Arrow-ized cut-down version of the LL(1) parser combinators
	described in "Deterministic, Error-Correcting Combinator Parsers",
	by Swierstra and Duponcheel.  This version uses statically
	constructed parse tables, but doesn't do error correction.

powertrees
	An arrow for uniform algorithms over perfectly balanced binary
	trees, which can express many hardware algorithms and data-parallel
	algorithms.

small
	Miscellaneous small examples.
