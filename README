A preprocessor for arrow notation packaged by Jose Iborra,
based on the arrowp preprocessor developed by Ross Paterson <ross@soi.city.ac.uk>.

Notable features include support for GHC Haskell syntax and a
quasiquoter that can be used instead of the preprocessor.

Note that recent versions of GHC support this notation directly, and
give better error messages to boot. But the translation produced by GHC
is in some cases not as good as it could be.

USING THE proc QUASI QUOTER
==============================

addA :: Arrow a => a b Int -> a b Int -> a b Int
addA f g = [proc| x -> do
		y <- f -< x
		z <- g -< x
		returnA -< y + z |]
